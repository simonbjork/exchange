 | Lock camera                 | Lock transform values for imported cameras.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
 | Correct fps                 | Ensure the current scene uses the same FPS as the import.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
 | Mesh as file                | Execute the "Export as file" command for selected mesh objects. Otherwise, export mesh objects as locators.                                                                                                                                                                               |
 | Mesh as plane               | Export mesh objects that are single planes (no volume) as "cards". Ignored if "Mesh as file" is enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
 | Modifiers                   | Evaluate the mesh geometry before exporting vertices or faces (planes). Note: Only vertex export supports animated modifiers.                                                                                                                                                             |

 | Add aspect mask             | Add an aspect mask to the camera (if possible).                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
 | Use square pixels           | Force the use of square pixels. Multiplies the width by the pixel aspect ratio.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
 | Import dialog               | Open an import dialog for file import (e.g., `.abc`, `.usd`).                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
 | Import using default settings| Import files (e.g., `.abc`, `.usd`) using Blender's default settings. Ignored if "Import dialog" is enabled.                                                                                                                                                                               |
 | Hide meshes                 | Hide unselected meshes before export. This may speed up export time in some cases.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
 | Hide modifiers              | Hide (unselected) meshes with modifiers before export. This may speed up export time in some cases.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
 | Hide geometry nodes         | Hide (unselected) meshes with geometry nodes modifiers before export. This may speed up export time in some cases.                                                                                                                                                                         |
 | Pretty json                 | If enabled, the exported JSON file will use "human-readable" formatting. This may slow down imports in non-Python applications like After Effects.                                                                                                                                        |
 | Use file                    | Open a file browser for export/import of data.
